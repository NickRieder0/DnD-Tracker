# DnD-Tracker
This discord bot's main purpose is to be used as an organizational tool for Dungeons & Dragons (DnD) campaigns.

It has several capabilities leveraging discord's built-in features, including Polls and Scheduled Events, to streamline
the session scheduling process.

TODO: 
- Create a database to allow for DMs/PCs to store and track relevant campaign information
- Create slash commands to submit information to the databse (i.e. PC information, important NPCs, lore)
- Create slash commands to retrieve information from the database 
- Add access levels to allow for DMs to input campaign information ahead of time without the players' being able to see it
- Give DMs ability to manipulate when players have access to relevant story information in database
- Create slash commands to compartmentalize campaigns and remove old campaign data from database
